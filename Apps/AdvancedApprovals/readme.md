# Microsoft Power Platform Advanced Approvals Kit
Advanced Approvals Kit is a collection of components and tools that are designed to help organizations digitalize the approval processes. 
The assets part of the Advanced Approvals Kit should be seen as a template from which you can either use as it is, or can serve as inspiration for implementing your own custom approval solutions.

## Latest Release

The latest shipped version is available via **[Releases](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit/releases)**. From there, you can download the latest version of all managed solutions that have been tested and are ready for use. 

## Support
Please do not open a support ticket if you encounter any bugs with the solution itself, unless it is related to an underlying platform issue unrelated to the template's implementation. If there are issues related to the solution implementation itself, please create as a new issue here.
